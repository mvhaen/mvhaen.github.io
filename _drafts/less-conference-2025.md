The [2025 Global LeSS Conference Amsterdam](https://less.works/conferenza/conferences/2025-global-less-conference-amsterdam-13/program_list) was really worth it. Meeting up with old friends, sharing experiences, inspiring presentations, and with the open space I had so much trouble choosing what to attend.

I've tried to capture some of my notes here.

### Day 1 - Roland and Ralph's Talk: *Doing a LeSS Flip in two months (A TURBO LeSS Adoption At Greenflux)*

Some takeaways that stood out to me:

- Learning-by-doing before formal LeSS training can work. Greenflux started with basic team training but didn’t explicitly “do LeSS” until months later. This resonates with my Selligent flip: that week was intense and practical, but much of it stayed surface-level. It was only years later, diving deeper for Strobbo, that concepts truly clicked. Repetition and spacing seem key to durable learning.
- It wasn’t really a “turbo LeSS” so much as shifting the sequence in time. Some elements were delayed, the teams felt the pain of adoption, and still made their way through — a reminder that discomfort is normal when real change is happening.
- TODO: Multi-learning matters. Encourage breadth and depth over time (pairing/rotations, communities of practice, whole‑product focus) so teams can adapt as structures evolve; this compounds learning across people and the product.

### Day 2 - Tom Jans' Talk: *Strongly Committed Teams — A Theory from Philosophy Applied to My Latest LeSS Flip*

Tom Jans ([simplytom.be](https://simplytom.be)) opened his session by introducing the concept of **joint commitment**, drawing from the philosophical work of Margaret Gilbert. He explored how this idea translates into agile teamwork and LeSS transformations, showing how teams move beyond individual intentions to act as a genuine collective.

![Make Philosophy Sexy Again - Tom Jans' presentation slide](/assets/images/2025-01-26-less-conference-2026/make-philosophy-sexy-again.jpeg)

#### What Is Joint Commitment?

A **joint commitment** is more than each person deciding individually to pursue a goal. It’s a shared undertaking where people commit *together as a body*, creating a relational bond that gives rise to mutual obligations. This is what allows a group to act as a cohesive “we,” rather than a collection of “I”s. Once such a commitment is formed, each member has a reason to maintain it — not just for their own sake, but for the others who share in it.

#### A Takeaway: Resilience Through Shared Promise

One of Tom’s main takeaways was that strong joint commitment builds resilience. When a team has truly committed together, difficulties don’t signal the end of the road; they invite renewed engagement. Because the commitment is mutual, people feel compelled to address challenges, repair setbacks, and adapt — rather than walk away and risk breaking their shared promise. The commitment itself becomes a living force that keeps the team aligned when things get tough.

#### Seeing the Invisible: New Insights

Once you understand the concept of joint commitment, you begin to see why certain practices in agile teams matter so much — even when they don’t seem like “commitments” at first glance. Tom used **team agreements** and **sprint goals** as examples. These may look like simple coordination tools, but through the lens of joint commitment they become **relational anchors**. They tie the team together behind a shared purpose and create the social glue that makes mutual accountability and care possible.

### Day 1 & 2 - Open Space Sessions

The Open Space format was a highlight of the conference, allowing participants to propose and attend sessions on topics that mattered most to them. The marketplace was bustling with diverse topics ranging from technical practices to organizational challenges.

### Day 1 & 2 - Open Space — Talking to Leadership and Management about LeSS

I joined both of these sessions because I've found myself struggling with this challenge too. It's not an easy topic to bring to management, and I was curious to hear different perspectives on how to navigate these conversations effectively.

{% include carousel.html number="2" %}

Two Open Space sessions — one with **Viktor Grcic**, the other with **Bastiaan**, CEO of the LeSS Company — explored how to engage management and leadership in meaningful conversations about LeSS.  
Both emphasized that transformation begins not with a framework but with understanding the organization's reality.

#### The Core Challenge

Executives live in a world of constraints — commercial pressure, risk, and expectations of predictability. The key is to approach them with genuine curiosity and empathy, uncovering what they are really trying to optimize for. From there, you can connect LeSS principles to tangible business concerns such as decision latency, coordination overhead, or slow learning cycles.

#### Viktor's Approach: "How to Convince C-Level to Do Transformation to LeSS"

**Viktor's session** emphasized genuine curiosity over sales tactics, using storytelling to build bridges, and confronting hesitation with consequence-focused questions.

Rather than pitching adoption, the focus should be on **improving outcomes**: delivering value faster, reducing waste, and enabling learning across teams. The tone was pragmatic and respectful — avoid agile jargon; speak about **value, speed, and responsiveness.** Show evidence, not ideology.

When leaders become hesitant or try to back away, Viktor's approach was particularly effective: confront the consequences of not addressing the problem directly, then position yourself as the expert while leaving them room to find their own solution. Questions like "So you don't want to solve the problem of most of your teams not working on what is most important?" followed by "So how would you solve this problem in other ways? Because I only know the solution that I suggested to you" — this technique closes the door on inaction while opening space for their own discovery.

#### Empowering Agile Coaches: A Different Approach

**Bastiaan's session** had a different goal: finding ways to empower agile coaches in their conversations with leadership. While Viktor shared his personal approach to engaging executives, Bastiaan focused on understanding how leadership looks at risks and decision-making, then translating that into tools coaches could use.

We leaned into the idea that you could approach this from a "jobs to be done" lens: understand their struggles, see what outcomes would be perceived as positive, and only then dive into solutions. This could lead to creating a translation table that helps in these discussions and allows coaches to piggyback on leadership's way of thinking.

We noticed that in most cases, leaders will not be opposed to people interacting more or taking more ownership. They're just not sure how to truly realize that — and that's exactly where agile coaches come in.

#### Broader Conference Context

A few additional insights emerged from other conference discussions:

1. **It takes time and you can't push this.** Real organizational change requires patience and can't be rushed or forced.

2. **LeSS requires real change.** As Craig Larman emphasized in the Q&A, LeSS demands genuine transformation of how work gets done. As Maarten Dalmijn pointed out in his talk, frameworks like SAFe and Team Topologies are often easier to deploy because they typically map pretty directly onto existing organizational structures.

> 💬 *Transformation doesn't start when management approves LeSS; it starts when they join the conversation about what's getting in the way of delivering value.*
