If you've ever struggled to create a roadmap that actually delivers on time and meets expectations, you're not alone. At Strobbo, I faced this challenge repeatedly—roadmaps that looked great on paper but fell apart when reality hit. The problem wasn't the planning itself, but how we were shaping the items on our roadmap.

What I really wanted was a roadmap with margin—room to move around when things start to change. After all, change is inevitable in product development, isn't it?

### The Three Variables You Can Actually Control

Here's what I've learned: when you're shaping roadmap items, you need to think in terms of variables you can adjust. You might have additional ones like security, user experience, or performance, but the three core elements I focus on are scope, time, and quality.

The key principle I always stick to? You don't want to cave on quality.

### The Most Common Mistake I See

The most common mistake I see teams make is creating a situation where scope is fixed and time becomes the only variable you can adjust. When problems arise, the only escape route is extending your timeline. Sound familiar?

This trap most easily occurs when we put features on a roadmap. I've seen this happen time and again—features become honey traps for ideas, expectations, and assumptions. When you communicate about features with customers or stakeholders, they start filling in how it will solve their problem. Then when reality hits and it doesn't deliver as expected, the misery begins.

Feature roadmaps also shift focus from solving problems to creating features—a subtle but dangerous distinction. We fall in love with the feature, not the problem. The goal becomes to deliver the feature, not to get a solution in the hands of the customer. And the moment you fall in love with the feature, that's also when scope creep starts.

### But What If We Flipped the Script?

That's where outcome-based, goal-oriented roadmaps shine. We start from the problem and work towards a meaningful outcome that addresses it. The word "outcome" is crucial here—it focuses on what will change, not just what we'll build.

In my experience, moving from solution to problem is a big leap forward. But moving from problem to outcome? That's equally important, and it's what separates good roadmaps from great ones.

When we focus on outcomes, we give ourselves the flexibility to adjust scope and time while maintaining quality. We're not locked into specific features—we're committed to solving real problems and delivering meaningful results.

### Exploring Different Approaches to Variable Control

Let's investigate the alternatives to feature-based roadmaps where scope is fixed and time becomes the only escape route.

One approach is to fix time and make scope completely variable. This is what [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) does—they form bets of fixed time periods (typically six weeks) where the scope can vary. What I like about this approach is that the team has full control over scope while working on the bet. And even if they fail to deliver anything, the system prevents them from continuing automatically, since work only continues if a new bet is made.

This creates a powerful mechanism for teams to control their clock. You need to make sure that during your work there are moments to stop, pause, and reflect if you're still moving in the right direction or need to course correct.

I take a different approach with my [betting methodology](/2024/10/20/bet-on-your-roadmap/). Instead of fixed time periods, I use variable-sized bets measured in sprints. The idea is to have meaningful discussions about investment—how much are you willing to spend on this outcome? This creates natural checkpoints during development where you can decide whether to adjust scope, extend the timeline, or both. Since we use sprints like in Scrum, every sprint review becomes a way to "control our clock" and reflect on whether we're still moving in the right direction.

### What This Means for Your Roadmap

Here's what I've found works:

- **Start with the problem**: What are you really trying to solve?
- **Define the outcome**: What will change when you're successful?
- **Leave room for creativity**: Don't lock yourself into specific features too early
- **Build in margin**: Plan for the inevitable changes that will come

The result? A roadmap that's both predictable and flexible—exactly what you need to deliver value consistently while adapting to change.
