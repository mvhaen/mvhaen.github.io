# Writing Style Guide for Michael Voorhaen's Blog

## Core Style Philosophy
**Write as if you're having a conversation with a colleague over coffee, sharing practical insights from your real experience.**

## Key Style Characteristics

### 1. Personal and Experiential Tone
- **Use first-person when sharing experiences**: "I faced the same challenge at Strobbo..."
- **Share specific examples**: Reference real situations from your work
- **Be authentic**: Acknowledge challenges and learning moments

**Examples from your articles:**
- "At Strobbo, I faced the same challenge. I spent a long time searching for the right format..."
- "In my experience, these discussions are most effective when you have both stakeholders and the team present..."

### 2. Conversational Language
- **Use contractions**: "you're", "it's", "don't", "we'll"
- **Ask rhetorical questions**: Engage readers with questions they can relate to
- **Use natural speech patterns**: Write like you speak

**Examples:**
- "But what if we flipped the script?"
- "Wouldn't it be great to have a more collaborative and less time-consuming way?"
- "Are you wondering how you can ensure that your organizational structure truly aligns with your long-term business goals?"

### 3. Problem-Solution Structure
- **Start with relatable problems**: Hook readers with challenges they recognize
- **Present clear solutions**: Follow problems with actionable advice
- **Use smooth transitions**: Guide readers from problem to solution

**Example structure:**
1. Problem identification
2. "But what if we..." transition
3. Solution explanation
4. Practical implementation tips

### 4. Collaborative and Inclusive Tone
- **Use inclusive language**: "we", "our team" rather than accusatory "you"
- **Acknowledge shared challenges**: "you're not alone"
- **Focus on solutions**: Always pair problems with actionable advice

**Examples:**
- "If you've ever struggled to create a roadmap that actually drives meaningful progress, you're not alone."
- "This approach not only shifts the dynamic but also ensures you're taking responsibility for investment decisions in a way that engages the whole team."

### 5. Specific and Actionable Content
- **Provide concrete examples**: Use bullet points and specific scenarios
- **Give practical techniques**: Include "how-to" guidance
- **Use numbered lists**: For step-by-step processes

**Examples:**
- Bullet points for clear goals
- Specific techniques like "1 sprint for 1 team"
- Step-by-step guides for implementation

### 6. Visual and Engaging Elements
- **Use subheadings**: Break content into digestible sections
- **Include images and carousels**: Support text with visual elements
- **Use formatting**: Bold key concepts, italicize emphasis

## Style Rules to Follow

### ✅ DO:
- Start articles with relatable problems or challenges
- Use first-person when sharing personal experiences
- Include specific examples from your work
- Use conversational language and contractions
- Ask rhetorical questions to engage readers
- Provide actionable, practical advice
- Use inclusive language ("we", "our team")
- Break content into digestible sections with subheadings
- Include visual elements to support your points

### ❌ DON'T:
- Write in an overly formal or academic tone
- Use accusatory language ("you always do this wrong")
- Make claims without backing them up with experience
- Write in long, dense paragraphs without breaks
- Skip the problem identification before presenting solutions
- Use jargon without explanation
- Write in a way that sounds like a textbook

## Common Phrases and Transitions

### Opening Problems:
- "If you've ever struggled to..."
- "You're not alone if..."
- "At [Company], I faced the same challenge..."

### Transitions to Solutions:
- "But what if we flipped the script?"
- "That's where [Solution] comes in."
- "Here's what I've found works..."

### Experience Sharing:
- "In my experience..."
- "I've seen this happen time and again..."
- "What I really wanted was..."

### Inclusive Language:
- "We start from the problem..."
- "Our team can focus on..."
- "When we communicate about features..."

## Sentence Structure Guidelines

### Prefer:
- Short, clear sentences
- Active voice
- Specific examples over general statements
- Personal experience over theoretical concepts

### Example Transformation:
**Before (too formal/theoretical):**
"This trap most easily occurs when we put features on a roadmap. Features are honey traps for ideas, expectations, and assumptions."

**After (your style):**
"This trap most easily occurs when we put features on a roadmap. I've seen this happen time and again—features become honey traps for ideas, expectations, and assumptions."
