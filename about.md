### Professional Background

Currently, I am a Product Manager at Protime, overseeing everything related to our planning domain and serving as the Product Owner for our product, Strobbo. While my daily responsibilities no longer include coding, my heart remains with software craftsmanship. With a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Antwerp, I began my career focused on technical research and development in wireless networks with Meshbone. Over the years, my expertise has expanded from front-end and back-end development—working with technologies like QT, AngularJS, Angular, Linux, C++, and Java—to leading strategic product development teams.

### Agile and Leadership Expertise

My technical journey is enriched by strong leadership in Agile and Scrum methodologies. I hold certifications as a Professional Scrum Product Owner, Scrum Facilitator, and [LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)](https://less.works/) practitioner. Additionally, I am certified in [Designing Agile Organizations](https://creatingagileorganizations.com/) and am an [Org Topologies](https://orgtopologies.com/) Champion, skills I use to reshape and guide organizational structures towards agility and efficiency.

### Personal Interests

Outside of work, I find balance through meditation and yoga, practices that enhance my focus and perspective. My hobbies include archery, running, reading (both fiction and non-fiction), gaming, and cooking.

I invite you to connect with me to explore how we can drive forward impactful and innovative technology solutions together.
