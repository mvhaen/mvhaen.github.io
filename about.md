## About Me

Hello! I'm Michael Voorhaen, a technology enthusiast with a deep passion for software development, product management, and Agile methodologies. I thrive on the challenge of creating innovative solutions that solve real-world problems and enhance people's lives. My mission is to share my knowledge and experiences to inspire others and contribute to the tech community.

### Professional Background

Currently, I am a Product Manager at Protime, overseeing everything related to our planning domain and serving as the Product Owner for our product, Strobbo. While my daily responsibilities no longer include coding, my heart remains with software craftsmanship. With a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Antwerp, I began my career focused on technical research and development in wireless networks with Meshbone. Over the years, my expertise has expanded from front-end and back-end development—working with technologies like QT, AngularJS, Angular, Linux, C++, and Java—to leading strategic product development teams.

### Agile and Leadership Expertise

My technical journey is enriched by strong leadership in Agile and Scrum methodologies. I hold certifications as a Professional Scrum Product Owner, Scrum Facilitator, and LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum) practitioner. Additionally, I am certified in Designing Agile Organizations and am an Org Topologies Champion, skills I use to reshape and guide organizational structures towards agility and efficiency.

### Personal Interests

Outside of work, I find balance through meditation and yoga, practices that enhance my focus and perspective. My hobbies include archery, running, reading (both fiction and non-fiction), gaming, and cooking.

### Connect with Me

I invite you to connect with me to explore how we can drive forward impactful and innovative technology solutions together.

Feel free to reach out and let's make a difference in the tech world!
