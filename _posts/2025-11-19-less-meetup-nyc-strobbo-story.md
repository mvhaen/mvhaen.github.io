Excited to share that I spoke at the LeSS Meetup NYC about Strobbo’s bumpy journey—from fast-moving startup, through the inevitable scaling slowdown, and back to real business agility.

If you’ve ever wondered how to keep learning alive when the team count explodes, that’s exactly what we unpacked together: what worked, what failed, and the experiments that helped us restore focus and flow.

The recording (plus my slides) is now online thanks to Gene Gendel’s write-up: [LeSS Talks: Strobbo: From Startup to Scaling Slowdown and Returning to Business Agility](https://www.keystepstosuccess.com/2025/11/less-talks-strobbo-from-startup-to-scaling-slowdown-and-returning-to-business-agility-with-michael-voorhaen/).
