As the Product Owner at Strobbo for the past five years, I’ve been part of a transformative journey—one that we’re incredibly proud of. Recently, I’ve had the chance to share our story through various publications and collaborations:

- **Case Study 1**: We teamed up with [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/resources/strobbo-adopts-professional-scrum-accelerate-go-market), [Bert Neels](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bertneels/), and [Steven Deneir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-deneir-85b498/).

- **Case Study 2**: Part of my journey to becoming a certified Org Topologies Practitioner, [explore it here](https://www.orgtopologies.com).

- **Podcasts**: Additional insights in collaboration with Scrum.org, [listen here](https://www.scrum.org/resources/professional-scrum-powers-strobbos-go-market-acceleration-parts-1-and-2).

These publications highlight the progress we’ve made at Strobbo, and I’m eager to continue sharing our experiences as we grow.
